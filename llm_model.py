        These are the Rules you need to follow before you answer the question:
        - Any university course information should only be answered based on only the information provided in the student report file. Any additional information should not be considered.
        - All answers should only be based on the {student_report_document} student report file, {score_grade} score grade file, and {subject_weight_values} subject weight values file before providing any answers.
        - All answer outputs should only be followed based on the criteria and format provided.
        
                                       
                                                       
        1. Determine the Subject Grade Value (NGMP):
        - To calculate the STPM pointer, the weighted value of each subject is different. Below is an example of how to calculate the values for different subjects.
        - The STPM has 4 subjects and 3 semesters overall. The student's CGPA is calculated based on the subjects taken.
        Example:
        General Studies NGMP Calculation Method:
        - Weighted Value (%) X Subject Grade Pointer รท 100 = new value

        Subject: General Studies
        - Grade: A, General Studies 1 : 4.0, Weight: 29%, Mark: 1.16
        - Grade: B, General Studies 2 : 3.0, Weight: 22%, Mark: 0.66
        - Grade: A, General Studies 3 : 4.0, Weight: 29%, Mark: 1.16
        - Grade: A, General Studies Coursework 4 (KK) : 4.0, Weight: 20%, Mark: 0.8
        Total: 3.78
        - Grade: A-, NGMP: 3.67

        Subject: Accounts
        - Grade: A, Accounts 1 : 4.0, Weight: 28%, Mark: 1.12
        - Grade: A, Accounts 2 : 4.0, Weight: 28%, Mark: 1.12
        - Grade: A-, Accounts 3 : 3.67, Weight: 20%, Mark: 0.73
        - Grade: A, Accounts Coursework 4 (KK) : 4.0, Weight: 20%, Mark: 0.8
        Total: 3.69
        - Grade: A-, NGMP: 3.67

        Subject: Economics
        - Grade: A-, Economics 1 : 3.67, Weight: 26.67%, Mark: 0.98
        - Grade: A-, Economics 2 : 3.67, Weight: 26.67%, Mark: 0.98
        - Grade: B+, Economics 3 : 3.33, Weight: 26.67%, Mark: 0.89
        - Grade: A, Economics Coursework 4 (KK) : 4.0, Weight: 20%, Mark: 0.8
        Total: 3.65
        - Grade: B+, NGMP: 3.33

        Subject: History
        - Grade: A-, History 1 : 3.67, Weight: 29%, Mark: 1.06
        - Grade: B, History 2 : 3.00, Weight: 22%, Mark: 0.66
        - Grade: A, History 3 : 4.00, Weight: 29%, Mark: 1.16
        - Grade: A, History Coursework 4 (KK) : 4.0, Weight: 20%, Mark: 0.8
        Total: 3.68
        - Grade: A-, NGMP: 3.67

        2. Calculation of CGPA:
        - The student's CGPA is calculated based on the four best subjects taken by the candidate only.
        - Formula: Total NGMP รท 4 = CGPA

        Example:
        - General Studies: 3.67
        - Accounts: 3.67
        - Economics: 3.33
        - History: 3.67
        Total NGMP: 3.67 + 3.67 + 3.33 + 3.67 = 14.34
        CGPA: 14.34 รท 4 = 3.585
        
        3. verify the student's CGPA. If the student's CGPA is more than 4.0 then recalculate the CGPA again.
        
        4. The output after the calculation of the CGPA should follow the format below:
            Example Output:
            - General Studies: 3.67
            - Accounts: 3.67
            - Economics: 3.33
            - History: 3.67
            Total NGMP: 3.67 + 3.67 + 3.33 + 3.67 = 14.34
            CGPA: 14.34 รท 4 = 3.585

            Therefore, your current CGPA is 3.585.

        
        With the above information, you can now answer the following questions:
