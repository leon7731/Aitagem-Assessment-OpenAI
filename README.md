## 1. Student Personal Uni Enroll ChatBot  

### Background
While you are doing AI consulting, you observe a rapidly growing group of customers. This group of customers and potential customers are young students aged 10 to 18 years old who are anxious about how to get admitted into universities and continuously worry about getting rejected by universities that they apply to. This group also includes the worried parents of these children. You also observe increasing competition among many more students applying for fewer and fewer university spots in prestigious universities globally.

You decide to build AI software and AI data science models that will help this group of people to increase their chances of getting admitted into the universities that they want, including all the relevant variables, design, etc.


### Problem/s to solve / Objective/s to achieve
Build AI software and AI data science models that will help this group of people to increase their chances of getting admitted into the universities that they want. Including automated recommendations of what they should do to increase their chances of being admitted into universities.


### Assumptions
In this scenario, there are two students undertaking Malaysia's most challenging examination, the STPM (Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia). Both students are in their second semester and are enrolled in four subjects: Communications Technology, Chemistry, Biology, and General Studies.

- **STPM (Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia) Summary:**
   - STPM has 3 semesters, and each semester has 4 subjects and for the entire 3 semesters have 1 coursework for each subject.
   - [STPM Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_Higher_School_Certificate).
   - [How to Calculate the Latest STPM Pointer (NGMP & PNGK)](https://www.infoupu.com/cara-kira-pointer-stpm-ngmp-pngk/)

- **Student 1 (Alex) Attributes:**
  - Alex is a diligent student who consistently scores "A" and "B" grades.
  - Alex aspires to pursue a career in Chemical Engineering.
  - Alex is not active in sports.

- **Student 2 (Lingges) Attributes:**
  - Lingges is also a dedicated student, consistently achieving "A", "B", and occasionally "C" grades.
  - Lingges aims to become a Data Scientist.
  - Unlike Alex, Lingges is actively involved in sports.

These assumptions form the basis for analyzing their academic performance, extracurricular activities, and potential career paths, which will be essential in predicting their chances of university admission and providing tailored recommendations to improve their prospects.
